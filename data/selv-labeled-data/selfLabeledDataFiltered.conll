about	O
the	O

first	O

all	O

just	O
a	O
--	O
a	O
little	O
context	O
up	O

You	O

is	O
one	O
of	O
our	O

,	O
and	O
that	O
--	O
that	O

continues	O
and	O
will	O
continue.	O
So	O
this	O
is	O
certainly	O
a	O
regrettable	O
incident	O

approximately	O
11:40	B-Temporal

It	O
's	O
important	O
to	O
point	O
out	O
that	O
no	O
U.S.	B-Organisation

were	O
injured	O
during	O
the	O
incident.	O
We	O
have	O
no	O

that	O
the	O

that	O
Turkey	B-Location
was	O
intentionally	O
targeting	O
U.S.	B-Organisation
forces.	I-Organisation
And	O
as	O
I	O
mentioned	O
,	O
the	O

did	O
talk	O
to	O
his	O

had	O
to	O
shoot	O
down	O
the	B-MilitaryPlatform

of	O
another	O

GEN.	B-Person

:	O
Yes	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
again	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
regrettable	O
incident	O
but	O
U.S.	B-Organisation
commanders	I-Organisation
on	O
the	O
ground	O
did	O
assess	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
potential	O
threat	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
took	O
prudent	O
action	O
in	O
this	O
scenario.	O
But	O
again	O
,	O
the	B-Person
secretary	I-Person
has	O
talked	O
to	O
his	O

They	O
had	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O

a	O
fruitful	O

again	O
commit	O

one	O

will	O
continue	O
to	O

Thank	O
you	O
very	O
much	O

General.	B-Person
First	O
question	O
,	O
was	O
the	B-Location
United	I-Location
States	I-Location
or	O
the	O
chain	O
of	O
command	O
really	O
thinking	O
that	O
the	B-MilitaryPlatform
Turkish	I-MilitaryPlatform
UAVs	I-MilitaryPlatform
were	O
going	O
to	O
strike	O
American	O
bases	O
there	O
?	O
Is	O
that	O
why	O
this	O
strike	O
was	O
done	O
?	O
You	O
know	O
learning	O
the	B-MilitaryPlatform
Turkish	I-MilitaryPlatform
drone	I-MilitaryPlatform
was	O
shut	O
down	O
because	O
all	O
rules	O
of	O

have	O
changed.	O
That	O
's	O
why	O
this	O
incident	O
took	O

?	O

GEN.	B-Person
RYDER	I-Person
:	O
Yes.	O
Well	O
,	O
again	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
--	O
as	O
I	O
laid	O
out	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
situation	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
and	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
observation	O
,	O
the	O
decision	O
was	O
made	O
out	O
of	O
due	O
diligence	O
and	O
the	O
inherent	O
right	O
of	O
self-defense	O
to	O
take	O
appropriate	O
action	O
to	O
protect	O
U.S.	B-Organisation
forces	I-Organisation
.	O

As	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
discussions	O
with	O
the	B-Person
Turkish	I-Person
defense	I-Person
minister	I-Person
and	O
post	O
shoot	O

analysis	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
initial	O
indications	O
that	O
--	O
that	O
Turkey	B-Location
--	O
Turkey	B-Location
was	O
intentionally	O
targeting	O
U.S.	B-Organisation
forces	I-Organisation
.	O

Again	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
regrettable	O
incident	O
and	O
we	O
will	O
continue	O
to	O
keep	O
those	O
lines	O
of	O
communication	O
open	O
to	O
hopefully	O
prevent	O
these	O
types	O
of	O
incidents	O
from	O
happening	O
again	O
.	O

Q	O
:	O
Just	O
one	O
last	O
question	O
please	O
.	O

GEN.	B-Person
RYDER	I-Person
:	O
Sure	O
.	O

Q	O
:	O
So	O
you	O
told	O
CNN	B-Organisation
(	O
inaudible	O
)	O
just	O
last	O
night	O
that	O
the	B-Location
United	I-Location
States	I-Location
stands	O
firmly	O
by	O
Turkey	B-Location
and	O
it	O
's	O
people	O
and	O
their	O
legitimate	O
fight	O
against	O
the	B-Organisation
PKK.	I-Organisation
And	O
according	O
to	O
our	O
NATO	B-Organisation
ally	O
,	O
they	O
're	O
doing	O
exactly	O
that	O
in	O
Northern	B-Location
and	O
Eastern	B-Location
Syria	I-Location
.	O

So	O
this	O
difference	O
of	O
opinion	O
in	O
the	O
terminology	O
–	O
PKK	B-Organisation
,	O
YPG	B-Organisation
,	O
SDF	B-Organisation
–	O
how	O
are	O
you	O
looking	O
to	O
resolve	O
that	O
all	O
--	O
are	O
these	O
two	O
NATO	B-Organisation
allies	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
treating	O
each	O
other	O
?	O

GEN.	B-Person
RYDER	I-Person
:	O
Yes	O
,	O
thanks	O
Eunice.	B-Person
Well	O
,	O
let	O
me	O
just	O
reiterate	O
what	O
I	O
provided	O
to	O
you	O
yesterday.	B-Temporal
And	O
you	O
're	O
right.	O
As	O
I	O
've	O
said	O
in	O
my	O
opening	O
comments	O
,	O
we	O
do	O
stand	O
firmly	O
with	O
our	O
NATO	B-Organisation
ally	O
,	O
Türkey	B-Location
and	O
the	O
Turkish	O
people	O
in	O
their	O
fight	O
against	O
the	B-Organisation
PKK	I-Organisation
.	O

And	O
the	O
PKK	B-Organisation
has	O
been	O
designated	O
as	O
a	O
foreign	O
terrorist	O
organization	O
by	O
the	B-Location
United	I-Location
States.	I-Location
So	O
we	O
condemn	O
any	O
act	O
of	O
terrorism	O
against	O
Turkiye	B-Location
and	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
Turkey	O
and	O
we	O
recognize	O
that	O
the	O
PKK	B-Organisation
poses	O
a	O
legitimate	O
security	O
threat	O
.	O

When	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
Northern	B-Location
Syria	I-Location
,	O
we	O
do	O
remain	O
concerned	O
about	O
the	O
potential	O
impacts	O
of	O
military	O
escalation	O
in	O
that	O
region	O
in	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
it	O
effects	O
the	O
civilian	O
population	O
and	O
importantly	O
as	O
it	O
effects	O
our	O
ability	O
to	O
maintain	O
focus	O
on	O
rooting	O
out	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
.	O

And	O
so	O
the	O
coalition	O
and	O
the	B-Location
United	I-Location
States	I-Location
remain	O
very	O
,	O
very	O
focused	O
on	O
rooting	O
out	O
the	O
last	O
elements	O
of	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
in	O
this	O
region.	O
And	O
so	O
the	O
potential	O
for	O
escalation	O
,	O
military	O
escalation	O
in	O
that	O
region	O
can	O
serve	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
distraction	O
on	O
this	O
critical	O
work	O
,	O
create	O
instability	O
in	O
the	O
region	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
a	O
hard	O
--	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
've	O
talked	O
about	O
this	O
before	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
been	O
a	O
hard	O
fought	O
battle	O
to	O
prevent	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
from	O
resurging.	O
And	O
so	O
that	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
stay	O
focused	O
on.	O
We	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
advocate	O
for	O
de-escalation	O
in	O
the	O
maintenance	O
of	O
cease	O
fires.	O
But	O
we	O
will	O
never	O
question	O
Turkey	B-Location
's	I-Location
legitimate	O
right	O
to	O
protect	O
its	O
people	O
from	O
terrorist.	O

General.	B-Person
I	O
have	O
two	O
questions.	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
question	O
regarding	O
reports	O
suggesting	O
that	O
cooperation	O
between	O
the	B-Organisation
Iraqis	I-Organisation
central	I-Organisation
government	I-Organisation
and	O
Kurdistan	B-Organisation
forces	I-Organisation
Peshmerga	I-Organisation
has	O
been	O
highly	O
effective	O
in	O
countering	O
and	O
reducing	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
activities.	O
Could	O
you	O
please	O
provide	O
your	O
comment	O
on	O
this	O
matter	O
...	O

GEN.	B-Person
RYDER	I-Person
:	O
Sure.	O
Yes	O
,	O
I	O
'll	O
--	O
I	O
'll	O
--	O
I	O
'll	O
provide	O
a	O
broad	O
perspective	O
,	O
and	O
--	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
also	O
encourage	O
you	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
CJTF-OIR	B-Organisation
,	O
which	O
is	O
squarely	O
focused	O
on	O
supporting	O
Iraq	B-Location
in	O
the	O
Defeat	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
mission	O
.	O

But	O
largely	O
speaking	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
--	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
--	O
the	O
key	O
aspects	O
of	O
success	O
in	O
the	O
Defeat	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
mission	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
--	O
the	O
collaboration	O
between	O
the	O
ISF	B-Organisation
and	O
Peshmerga	B-Organisation
forces	I-Organisation
in	O
--	O
in	O
northern	B-Location
Iraq	I-Location
,	O
by	O
working	O
together	O
against	O
a	O
common	O
enemy	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
.	O

And	O
so	O
certainly	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
has	O
benefitted	O
not	O
only	O
Iraq	B-Location
but	O
the	O
region.	O
Thank	O
you	O

Q	O

the	B-Organisation
Houthis	I-Organisation
in	O
Yemen	B-Location
to	O
Ukraine.	B-Location
So	O
three	O
part	O
questions	O
.	O

GEN.	B-Person

:	O
Oh.	O
Can	O
we	O
only	O
do	O
two	O
?	O

(	O
LAUGHTER	O

Q	O
:	O
If	O
Iran	B-Location
continuing	O
to	O
send	O
arms	B-Weapon
to	O
the	B-Organisation
Houthis	I-Organisation
,	O
is	O
it	O
your	O
policy	O
to	O
seize	O
such	O
weapons	B-Weapon
when	O
you	O
can	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
appropriated	O
,	O
transfer	O
them	O
to	O
your	O
allies	O
?	O

GEN.	B-Person
RYDER	I-Person
:	O
Yes	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
'm	O
--	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
speculate	O
about	O
the	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
potential	O
future	O
operations.	O
Certainly	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
seen	O
Iran	B-Location
attempting	O
to	O
deliver	O
weapons	B-Weapon
and	O
aid	O
to	O
--	O
to	O
groups	O
like	O
the	B-Organisation
Houthis.	I-Organisation
And	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
in	O
violation	O
of	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
multiple	O
international	O
laws	O
,	O
those	O
--	O
those	O
assets	O
have	O
been	O
seized	O
.	O

Whether	O
or	O
not	O
we	O
will	O
replicate	O
this	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
remains	O
to	O
be	O
seen.	O
Certainly	O
,	O
when	O
--	O
when	O
we	O
did	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
under	O
legal	O
authorities.	O
In	O
this	O
particular	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
U.S.	B-Location
filed	I-Location
a	O
forfeiture	O
complaint	O
over	O
ammunition	O
received	O

or	O
seized	O
by	O
the	B-Organisation

Sea	I-Location
from	O
Iran	B-Location
in	O
early	O
of	O
December	B-Temporal
2022	I-Temporal
.	O

And	O
so	O
this	O
forfeiture	O
action	O
is	O
a	O
product	O
of	O
the	B-Organisation
U.S.	I-Organisation
government	I-Organisation
's	I-Organisation
coordinated	O
effort	O
to	O
enforce	O
U.S.	O
