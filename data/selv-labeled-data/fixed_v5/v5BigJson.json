Approached by the BBC on Saturday, Ukraine's 46th Air Assault Brigade said fighting was continuing near Russia's first line of defence, but that \"no one has yet managed to go beyond the first line.\" This may be less surprising than it sounds. A plethora of units are operating up and down the front, each concentrating on their own narrow section and specific tasks. They do not necessarily know what is going on elsewhere.

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland was \"no longer transferring any weapons to Ukraine\", although this was later reversed. So electoral politics are beginning to bite into Ukraine's support. So too are other issues, whether the global cost-of-living crisis or the climate emergency. At the United Nations General Assembly recently, it was noticeable how Ukraine was no longer automatically at the top of the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelensky's first in-person speeches to the UN assembly and the Security Council did not command the same attention as before. Diplomats noticed the sheen had come off the Ukrainian delegation as leaders from the Global South pressed their own agendas. All of this is what strategists in the Kremlin have been long been hoping for. Diplomats believe Vladimir Putin wants to wait out the West, keeping the fighting going until Ukraine begins to lose international support and seeks a political settlement.

But since the invasion of February 2022, the army has more than trebled in size, the nation mobilised and Jimmy's unit changed out of all recognition. We spent two weeks in August with the 24th, which now serves in the Donbas, that old centre of smokestack industries in the east, occupying a section of the front between Bakhmut and Horlivka. And we went to the home community in western Ukraine where the brigade was garrisoned before the war, and where many of its families still live. Jimmy - the Ukrainian army asks that we use soldiers' nicknames rather than their real ones - commands a company (usually about 120 troops), a post he stepped into last year. One officer told me that none of the 15 company commanders in post at the start of the war are still in place, all having been promoted or become casualties. In the run-up to war, the 24th Brigade was just over 2,000 strong, rotating its three battalions to the front line in eastern Ukraine for occasional tours of duty.

Yurii is unusual among the 24th's men in that the £2,600 ($3,195) he earns monthly (80% of which is combat pay) is less than his earnings in civilian life. Bearded, and with a banker's flair for selling a business plan, Yurii told me how the company has to be more ingenious than the Russians because the enemy have so many more drones. One of the officers revealed that although Yurii ranks as a simple private soldier, he basically runs this unit. That rethinking of the usual hierarchy is one of the differences between the pre-2022 army set-up and the force that now fights the Russians. Another is their willingness to overlook age and other factors that might have counted against volunteers before 2022.

At night, 12 KAB-500 bombs were dropped on the town.\" The BBC cannot verify his comments. Some 1,600 residents remain in Avdiivka. Most of them moved into basements long ago, but they don't always provide good protection. According to Mr Barabash, as a result of the latest attacks, one person was killed and at least two more are feared dead under the rubble. Russian attempts to move forward appear to be aimed at seizing the villages of Berdyche and Stepove to the north of Avdiivka and the villages of Tonenke and Severne to the south. Moscow asserts that its troops have \"improved their positions\" near Avdiivka and Russian military bloggers report that Russian forces have taken some strategic positions belonging to Ukrainians and already entered Stepove. Ukraine's military denies those reports but these intense battles suggest that Russia is trying to encircle the city of Avdiivka by pushing from the north and the south. The town has been well fortified and protected since 2014, making a Russian breakthrough inside Avdiivka much harder.

impact of the dam explosion is so huge that it is described as \"one of the biggest human-caused disasters of our time\", in a report by US research institute, the Wilson Centre. It also says that \"more than one million hectares of land in three southern oblasts of Ukraine - Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk - will be unusable for the next three to five years for lack of a water supply\". Damage worth an estimated $2bn (£1.6bn) was caused by the breach, excluding the cost of rebuilding it, according to Ukrainian authorities. They said more than two-thirds of the affected area was in Russian-occupied territory where the flooding was worse because the bank on that side of the river is lower. Watch on iPlayer: After Kakhovka, The Kakhovka dam held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to irrigate farms as well as provided drinking water. A report by the United Nations warns that there is unlikely to be enough rain to water farmers' crops, so people have been digging new wells and laying water supply lines with help from the authorities and aid groups. With help from volunteers, Vadym is building a new house, ploughing his fields to prepare for the season ahead and plans to lay a new water supply to help his community. \"Everything will work out,\" says Vadim. \"Life is wonderful. You can give in or become stronger.\" Image source, Family handout Image caption, Ivan Sheremet was killed by an explosive in southern Ukraine at the age of 20. Two days after we left Vadym's village he received some devastating news. His 20-year-old son, Ivan, was killed by an explosive by the side of a road, not far from his home. Vadim believes it was a Russian munition, although there is no way to confirm this at the moment. Since Russia's invasion, Ukraine has become one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, according to the United Nations. The head of the Red Cross's weapon contamination unit, Erik Tollefsen, says the dam disaster dislodged mines, exacerbating the problem. \"We knew where the hazards were. Now we don't. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream,\" he told the AFP news agency. Ukrainian government \/ UN estimates Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the destruction of the dam. Two days after it started to burst, a Norwegian agency analysed seismic signals from a regional station in Romania, which indicated an explosion at the same time the dam collapse was registered. Experts with the international human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance, which is implementing Western-backed efforts to support accountability for atrocities in Ukraine, visited the Kherson region from 10 to 11 June with Ukraine's prosecutor general and a team from the International Criminal Court. The group concluded it was \"highly likely\" that Russia was behind the attack."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-10-31T10:14:48.125787Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T12:22:37.981033Z","inner_id":44,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":7,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":906,"annotations":[{"id":642,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":38,"end":43,"text":"Vadym","labels":["Person"]},"id":"TN9zBx0DZ6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":132,"end":138,"text":"Ivan's","labels":["Person"]},"id":"6cTSGwBUJ-","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":321,"end":325,"text":"Ivan","labels":["Person"]},"id":"DwORguS_5a","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":463,"end":470,"text":"Ukraine","labels":["Location"]},"id":"PbvSW2ynYb","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2023-10-31T10:14:48.244254Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T10:14:48.244254Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":81.426,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"032e047c-5d26-4e46-9266-6b8b67a163cb","import_id":183,"last_action":null,"task":906,"project":7,"updated_by":null,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cfd67a01-Dataset.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Despite everything that has happened, Vadym is determined to rebuild his life and his farm.
