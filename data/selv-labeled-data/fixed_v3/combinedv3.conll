from	O

Eunice.	B-Person
Well	O
,	O
let	O
me	O
just	O
reiterate	O
what	O
I	O
provided	O
to	O
you	O
yesterday.	B-Temporal
And	O
you	O
're	O
right.	O
As	O
I	O
've	O
said	O
in	O
my	O
opening	O
comments	O
,	O
we	O
do	O
stand	O
firmly	O
with	O
our	O
NATO	B-Organisation
ally	O
,	O
Türkey	B-Location
and	O
the	O
Turkish	O
people	O
in	O
their	O
fight	O
against	O
the	B-Organisation
PKK	I-Organisation
.	O

And	O
the	B-Organisation
PKK	I-Organisation
has	O
been	O
designated	O
as	O
a	O
foreign	O
terrorist	O
organization	O
by	O
the	B-Location
United	I-Location
States.	I-Location
So	O
we	O
condemn	O
any	O
act	O
of	O
terrorism	O
against	O
Turkiye	B-Location
and	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
Turkey	B-Location
and	O
we	O
recognize	O
that	O
the	B-Organisation
PKK	I-Organisation
poses	O
a	O
legitimate	O
security	O
threat	O
.	O

When	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
Northern	B-Location
Syria	I-Location
,	O
we	O
do	O
remain	O
concerned	O
about	O
the	O
potential	O
impacts	O
of	O
military	O
escalation	O
in	O
that	O
region	O
in	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
it	O
effects	O
the	O
civilian	O
population	O
and	O
importantly	O
as	O
it	O
effects	O
our	O
ability	O
to	O
maintain	O
focus	O
on	O
rooting	O
out	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
.	O

And	O
so	O
the	O
coalition	O
and	O
the	B-Location
United	I-Location
States	I-Location
remain	O
very	O
,	O
very	O
focused	O
on	O
rooting	O
out	O
the	O
last	O
elements	O
of	O
ISIS	B-Organisation
in	O
this	O
region.	O
And	O
so	O
the	O
potential	O
for	O
escalation	O
,	O
military	O
escalation	O
in	O
that	O
region	O
can	O
serve	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
distraction	O
on	O
this	O
critical	O
work	O
,	O
create	O
instability	O
in	O
the	O
region	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
a	O
hard	O

you	O

a	O
hard	O
fought	O
battle	O
to	O
prevent	O
ISIS	B-Organisation

And	O
so	O
that	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
continue	O

We	O

when	O
we	O

this	O
,	O
we	O
did	O

In	O
this	O
