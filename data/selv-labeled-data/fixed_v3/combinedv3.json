Ukrainian officials are extremely tight-lipped when asked for precise details, preferring to allow the fog of war to shroud Kyiv's intentions and extremely reluctant to avoid releasing sensitive information. It does not help that the forces closest to the fight sometimes give very different accounts of what is happening at the front. Approached by the BBC on Saturday, Ukraine's 46th Air Assault Brigade said fighting was continuing near Russia's first line of defence, but that \"no one has yet managed to go beyond the first line.\" This may be less surprising than it sounds. A plethora of units are operating up and down the front, each concentrating on their own narrow section and specific tasks. They do not necessarily know what is going on elsewhere.

The United States is Ukraine's greatest supporter by a long way, allocating more than $110bn (£90bn) in military and economic support. Yet over the weekend, Congress ditched plans to give Ukraine another $6bn in a bitter internal battle over how to fund the federal government. Some Republicans think support for Ukraine should be curbed, others think it should be provided only if President Biden spends more on US border security. Mr Biden has promised Ukraine another $24bn soon, but that may now be vulnerable to internal US politics. On the other side of the Atlantic, Ukraine may be about to lose another ally.",

The ruling Law and Justice Party has promised to halt the import of cheap Ukrainian grain that Polish farmers oppose. The President, Andrzej Duda, has described Ukraine as a drowning man dragging down his rescuers. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland was \"no longer transferring any weapons to Ukraine\", although this was later reversed. So electoral politics are beginning to bite into Ukraine's support. So too are other issues, whether the global cost-of-living crisis or the climate emergency. At the United Nations General Assembly recently, it was noticeable how Ukraine was no longer automatically at the top of the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelensky's first in-person speeches to the UN assembly and the Security Council did not command the same attention as before. Diplomats noticed the sheen had come off the Ukrainian delegation as leaders from the Global South pressed their own agendas. All of this is what strategists in the Kremlin have been long been hoping for. Diplomats believe Vladimir Putin wants to wait out the West, keeping the fighting going until Ukraine begins to lose international support and seeks a political settlement. Western leaders insist they have the stamina to stay the course and show more strategic patience than Russia expects.",

But it will only be more tough and more painful if we falter.\" To counter that impression, EU foreign ministers visited Kyiv on Monday, meeting there collectively for the first time in a demonstration of support.

His unit, the 24th Mechanised Brigade, has a long history, and is part of the old regular Ukrainian army, fighting the Russians from 2014. But since the invasion of February 2022, the army has more than trebled in size, the nation mobilised and Jimmy's unit changed out of all recognition. We spent two weeks in August with the 24th, which now serves in the Donbas, that old centre of smokestack industries in the east, occupying a section of the front between Bakhmut and Horlivka. And we went to the home community in western Ukraine where the brigade was garrisoned before the war, and where many of its families still live. Jimmy - the Ukrainian army asks that we use soldiers' nicknames rather than their real ones - commands a company (usually about 120 troops), a post he stepped into last year. One officer told me that none of the 15 company commanders in post at the start of the war are still in place, all having been promoted or become casualties. In the run-up to war, the 24th Brigade was just over 2,000 strong, rotating its three battalions to the front line in eastern Ukraine for occasional tours of duty. Although the Ukrainian army rarely discusses numbers, sources told me it has now swelled to more than 7,000, with a total of five infantry battalions, four of artillery, a tank battalion and numerous other supporting elements",

Bearded, and with a banker's flair for selling a business plan, Yurii told me how the company has to be more ingenious than the Russians because the enemy have so many more drones. One of the officers revealed that although Yurii ranks as a simple private soldier, he basically runs this unit. That rethinking of the usual hierarchy is one of the differences between the pre-2022 army set-up and the force that now fights the Russians. Another is their willingness to overlook age and other factors that might have counted against volunteers before 2022.

From our analysis of social media and archive news reports, our conservative estimate would be that the 24th Brigade has lost something like 400 personnel in total. About 120 of these died during the fighting from 2014 to the start of 2022, the remainder since the Russian invasion. It has also had scores or even hundreds of men captured, another difficult topic for the authorities, since prisoner swaps have been very limited in scale so far. The wife of one prisoner of war told us that just 22 men from the 24th Brigade had returned so far and that all of the government departments she's written to had given her the same message: \"You should wait.",

Exercise Intrepid Maven is a U.S. Marine Corps Forces Central Command-conceptualized and -implemented exercise series, designed in late 2021, with the first iteration having occurred in Jordan in March 2022. The series, to include IM 23.3, is designed to strengthen partnerships, produce training opportunities, contribute to interoperability, and to improve conditions for regional security. Episodic in nature, Intrepid Maven, which occurs with anywhere from one to any of a number of partner nations during each iteration, is a force deployment-tailored training series designed to demonstrate persistence in partnering; to prepare for the demands of a volatile and fluid AOR; to conduct unit-level training in new and challenging areas, spaces and facilities; and to demonstrate service ability to project forces to meet emergent requirements, all with the objective of gaining and maintaining unit readiness, deterring malicious adversary intent and demonstrating global responsiveness for crisis-response and contingencies.",

At night, 12 KAB-500 bombs were dropped on the town.\" The BBC cannot verify his comments. Some 1,600 residents remain in Avdiivka. Most of them moved into basements long ago, but they don't always provide good protection. According to Mr Barabash, as a result of the latest attacks, one person was killed and at least two more are feared dead under the rubble. Russian attempts to move forward appear to be aimed at seizing the villages of Berdyche and Stepove to the north of Avdiivka and the villages of Tonenke and Severne to the south. Moscow asserts that its troops have \"improved their positions\" near Avdiivka and Russian military bloggers report that Russian forces have taken some strategic positions belonging to Ukrainians and already entered Stepove. Ukraine's military denies those reports but these intense battles suggest that Russia is trying to encircle the city of Avdiivka by pushing from the north and the south. The town has been well fortified and protected since 2014, making a Russian breakthrough inside Avdiivka much harder. For that reason they are trying to cut it off from the rest of Ukrainian-controlled territories and encircle it.",

    "text": "The impact of the dam explosion is so huge that it is described as \"one of the biggest human-caused disasters of our time\", in a report by US research institute, the Wilson Centre. It also says that \"more than one million hectares of land in three southern oblasts of Ukraine - Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk - will be unusable for the next three to five years for lack of a water supply\". Damage worth an estimated $2bn (£1.6bn) was caused by the breach, excluding the cost of rebuilding it, according to Ukrainian authorities. They said more than two-thirds of the affected area was in Russian-occupied territory where the flooding was worse because the bank on that side of the river is lower. Watch on iPlayer: After Kakhovka, The Kakhovka dam held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to irrigate farms as well as provided drinking water. A report by the United Nations warns that there is unlikely to be enough rain to water farmers' crops, so people have been digging new wells and laying water supply lines with help from the authorities and aid groups. With help from volunteers, Vadym is building a new house, ploughing his fields to prepare for the season ahead and plans to lay a new water supply to help his community. \"Everything will work out,\" says Vadim. \"Life is wonderful. You can give in or become stronger.\" Image source, Family handout Image caption, Ivan Sheremet was killed by an explosive in southern Ukraine at the age of 20. Two days after we left Vadym's village he received some devastating news. His 20-year-old son, Ivan, was killed by an explosive by the side of a road, not far from his home. Vadim believes it was a Russian munition, although there is no way to confirm this at the moment. Since Russia's invasion, Ukraine has become one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, according to the United Nations. The head of the Red Cross's weapon contamination unit, Erik Tollefsen, says the dam disaster dislodged mines, exacerbating the problem. \"We knew where the hazards were. Now we don't. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream,\" he told the AFP news agency. Ukrainian government \/ UN estimates Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the destruction of the dam. Two days after it started to burst, a Norwegian agency analysed seismic signals from a regional station in Romania, which indicated an explosion at the same time the dam collapse was registered. Experts with the international human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance, which is implementing Western-backed efforts to support accountability for atrocities in Ukraine, visited the Kherson region from 10 to 11 June with Ukraine's prosecutor general and a team from the International Criminal Court. The group concluded it was \"highly likely\" that Russia was behind the attack.",

One such monument sits in a private Ukrainian cemetery in Oakville, Ontario, and features the insignia of the Galicia Division. Another was put up by Ukrainian WWII veterans in Edmonton, Alberta. A third, also in Edmonton, depicts the bust of Roman Shukhevych, a Ukrainian nationalist leader and Nazi collaborator, whose units are accused of massacring Jews and Poles. Shukhevych's involvement, however, is a matter of debate and he was not a member of the Galicia Division. The monuments, which date back to the 1970s and 80s, have all been vandalised in recent years, with the word \"Nazi\" painted across them in red.",

Those who fought with Germany believed it would grant them an independent state free from Soviet rule, Prof Marples said. At the time, Ukrainians resented the Soviets for their role in the Great Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33, also known as Holodomor, which killed an estimated five million Ukrainians.",

The EU‘s commitment to civilian security in partner states is a tangible manifestation of its distinctive  approach to security which seeks to address the root causes of instability through strengthened and reformed rule of law institutions, as well as targeted aid. We now call it the integrated approach, where the whole of the EU tool kit, diplomacy, targeted funding programmes, and CSDP action are combined to deliver optimum effect on the ground. Back in 2003 the integrated approach concept had yet to be formulated but the significance of the idea was already well understood. And the unique potential of civilian CSDP in that context was evident.",

    "text": "20 years ago we had to start from scratch. There was no precedent or direct previous experience to draw on. An operating framework for civilian missions had to be imagined, a new lexicon had to be invented, a chain of command established. Duty of care towards mission personnel was - and remains - a primary consideration. Although we do everything in our power to mitigate risk for our mission personnel, civilian crisis management in a volatile environment inevitably carries risks, the kind of risk that the EU had not hitherto been exposed to. And of course we had to find the right people with the right skills to do the job on the ground. The successful launch of our first mission owes as much to the dedication and imagination of a small number of EU officials as it does to the vision and commitment of the Member States without whom CSDP is nothing. Together they turned a promising concept into an effective reality.",

    "text": "EUPM, despite the ravages and horrors of the Yugoslav wars, deployed at a time of hope and the expectation of a better tomorrow. The international order was largely aligned and the objective of global stability and peaceful conflict resolution was broadly shared. It was self-evident that a maturing European Union, which embodied these values more than any other global actor, could and should play a leading role in restoring stability on its own doorstep. Overtime four civilian missions have deployed in the Balkans, most with discreet police support mandates. The launch of EULEX Kosovo in 2008 marked a step change for the EU level of ambition both in terms of EU engagement in the Balkans and for CSDP civilian capabilities. EULEX to this day stands out as our most ambitious and comprehensive rule of law mission, and the only civilian mission to have been granted an executive mandate. At its height, EULEX employed three and a half thousand personnel engaged in every aspect of justice reform and law enforcement, working in partnership with Kosovo authorities. EULEX helped to entrench the rule of law in this nascent democracy. Today it continues to play a vital role in the security and stability not only of Kosovo itself but also indirectly of the region as a whole, paving the way for possible future EU accession across the Balkans to the benefit of all Europeans.",

    "text": "From the experience gained with the early missions, the EU understood the need for more permanent civilian CSDP structures. These would enable the EU to project its global security mission further afield and on a surer footing. In 2006, we established command and control guidelines which regulate the role and responsibilities of the individual heads of mission as well as their relationship with the Civilian Operations Commander and the Political Security Committee of the Council, establishing a clear chain of command. A permanent Headquarters for all civilian missions, the Civilian Conduct and Planning Capability that I am proud to lead today was established in 2007. The entry into Force of the Lisbon Treaty provided a further basis to set up a permanent framework for civilian CSDP action: The establishment of the EEAS, which combined Europe’s diplomatic and operational capabilities for the first time, was a pivotal moment for EU integrated action in third countries. In 2013, we adopted crisis management procedures, which ensured more systematic and predictable decision making. And of course in 2016 the EU adopted its first global strategy which provided a comprehensive political framework for the integrated approach to EU foreign policy engagement, including through CSDP.",

The Strategic Compass adopted in 2022 gives us a clear sense of direction and a level of ambition for civilian CSDP. We can expect more flexible, scalable and modular missions, faster decision-making, speedier deployments and improved resilience for missions to allow them to withstand the pressures of a more challenging security environment. We can also expect that EU civilian missions will increase cooperation with their military counterparts in EU military missions and Operations as well as with EU justice and home affairs actors such as Europol and the EU Border and Coastguard Force. A new Civilian Compact, due to be adopted by the Council in May 2023, will take stock of our achievements to date and reinforce the capacity of the Brussels Civilian Headquarters and our missions on the ground. Civilian CSDP will be primed to continue to serve the EU’s foreign policy objectives and the security of its citizens in more turbulent times.",

People in vulnerable and fragile settings, where governance is weak or lacking, are the ones that will suffer most.",

One proposal was to introduce an environmental advisor as a standard position in all missions and operations. More recently, the Strategic Compass called for all missions to have an environmental advisor by 2025.",

Under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, for example, the U.S. contracts for new military hardware from defense contractors and then sends that equipment to Ukraine once it is ready. The U.S. has also sent a substantial amount of equipment to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority. Under PDA, equipment that is already in U.S. military inventory is pulled from the inventory and sent overseas.",
