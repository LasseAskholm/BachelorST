Scalise has been largely supportive of aid. But any candidate for speaker may face demands from scores of Republicans who don’t want to send more money. In the most recent vote on sending aid to Ukraine in late September, which was over a comparatively small $300 million tranche, 117 Republicans – more than half the party’s conference – voted against it.",

Our missions cover a very broad spectrum of activity from the specialised, such as police training, to the more comprehensive, such as institution building or justice chain reform. Over the last 20 years some 15,000 international and local staff have deployed to fulfil the European Union’s ambition to play a meaningful role as a global security provider, working to stabilise and bolster fragile states based on the sound principle that improved security abroad contributes to European security at home.",

An operating framework for civilian missions had to be imagined, a new lexicon had to be invented, a chain of command established. Duty of care towards mission personnel was - and remains - a primary consideration. Although we do everything in our power to mitigate risk for our mission personnel, civilian crisis management in a volatile environment inevitably carries risks, the kind of risk that the EU had not hitherto been exposed to. And of course we had to find the right people with the right skills to do the job on the ground. The successful launch of our first mission owes as much to the dedication and imagination of a small number of EU officials as it does to the vision and commitment of the Member States without whom CSDP is nothing. Together they turned a promising concept into an effective reality.",

The international order was largely aligned and the objective of global stability and peaceful conflict resolution was broadly shared. It was self-evident that a maturing European Union, which embodied these values more than any other global actor, could and should play a leading role in restoring stability on its own doorstep. Overtime four civilian missions have deployed in the Balkans, most with discreet police support mandates. The launch of EULEX Kosovo in 2008 marked a step change for the EU level of ambition both in terms of EU engagement in the Balkans and for CSDP civilian capabilities. EULEX to this day stands out as our most ambitious and comprehensive rule of law mission, and the only civilian mission to have been granted an executive mandate. At its height, EULEX employed three and a half thousand personnel engaged in every aspect of justice reform and law enforcement, working in partnership with Kosovo authorities. EULEX helped to entrench the rule of law in this nascent democracy. Today it continues to play a vital role in the security and stability not only of Kosovo itself but also indirectly of the region as a whole, paving the way for possible future EU accession across the Balkans to the benefit of all Europeans.",

These would enable the EU to project its global security mission further afield and on a surer footing. In 2006, we established command and control guidelines which regulate the role and responsibilities of the individual heads of mission as well as their relationship with the Civilian Operations Commander and the Political Security Committee of the Council, establishing a clear chain of command. A permanent Headquarters for all civilian missions, the Civilian Conduct and Planning Capability that I am proud to lead today was established in 2007. The entry into Force of the Lisbon Treaty provided a further basis to set up a permanent framework for civilian CSDP action: The establishment of the EEAS, which combined Europe’s diplomatic and operational capabilities for the first time, was a pivotal moment for EU integrated action in third countries. In 2013, we adopted crisis management procedures, which ensured more systematic and predictable decision making. And of course in 2016 the EU adopted its first global strategy which provided a comprehensive political framework for the integrated approach to EU foreign policy engagement, including through CSDP.",

The high-level diplomatic effort that ended the war was flanked by the deployment of an EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) in Georgia to monitor the newly defined administrative border line.

We can also expect that EU civilian missions will increase cooperation with their military counterparts in EU military missions and Operations as well as with EU justice and home affairs actors such as Europol and the EU Border and Coastguard Force. A new Civilian Compact, due to be adopted by the Council in May 2023, will take stock of our achievements to date and reinforce the capacity of the Brussels Civilian Headquarters and our missions on the ground. Civilian CSDP will be primed to continue to serve the EU’s foreign policy objectives and the security of its citizens in more turbulent times.",

    "text": "Intrepid Maven 23.3 marks the second time USCENTCOM has conducted an Intrepid Maven exercise in the United Arab Emirates, and the seventh time Marines have held the exercise in the Middle East. Exercise Intrepid Maven is a U.S. Marine Corps Forces Central Command-conceptualized and -implemented exercise series, designed in late 2021, with the first iteration having occurred in Jordan in March 2022. The series, to include IM 23.3, is designed to strengthen partnerships, produce training opportunities, contribute to interoperability, and to improve conditions for regional security. Episodic in nature, Intrepid Maven, which occurs with anywhere from one to any of a number of partner nations during each iteration, is a force deployment-tailored training series designed to demonstrate persistence in partnering; to prepare for the demands of a volatile and fluid AOR; to conduct unit-level training in new and challenging areas, spaces and facilities; and to demonstrate service ability to project forces to meet emergent requirements, all with the objective of gaining and maintaining unit readiness, deterring malicious adversary intent and demonstrating global responsiveness for crisis-response and contingencies.",
