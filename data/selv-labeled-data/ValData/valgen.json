    "text": "On the 6th of November 2023 high ranking officials of the Danish military discussed how to deploy special forces in critically vulnerable areas in Cameroon. The budget was an important discussion point since the government did not want to spend more than 5 million dkk. The budget is meant to cover equipment expenses ranging from weapons to field rations for the soldiers. The weapons needed for the snipers are Saur SIG516 rifles with scopes and tripods. The citizens of the Adamawa region In Cameroon are vulnerable to attacks from corrupt military forces. These forces have branched off from the official military in Cameroon due to a difference of opinions. With Denmark and Cameroon being allies, it was decided on the meeting, that the expenses for the military aid to Cameroon could be covered by 6.5 million dkk. ",
