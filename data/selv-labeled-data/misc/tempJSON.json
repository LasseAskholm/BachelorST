    "text": "The fog of warIt is hard to assess the significance of the latest claims. Ukrainian officials are extremely tight-lipped when asked for precise details, preferring to allow the fog of war to shroud Kyiv's intentions and extremely reluctant to avoid releasing sensitive information. It does not help that the forces closest to the fight sometimes give very different accounts of what is happening at the front. Approached by the BBC on Saturday, Ukraine's 46th Air Assault Brigade said fighting was continuing near Russia's first line of defence, but that \"no one has yet managed to go beyond the first line.\" This may be less surprising than it sounds. A plethora of units are operating up and down the front, each concentrating on their own narrow section and specific tasks. They do not necessarily know what is going on elsewhere.

The United States is Ukraine's greatest supporter by a long way, allocating more than $110bn (£90bn) in military and economic support. Yet over the weekend, Congress ditched plans to give Ukraine another $6bn in a bitter internal battle over how to fund the federal government. Some Republicans think support for Ukraine should be curbed, others think it should be provided only if President Biden spends more on US border security. Mr Biden has promised Ukraine another $24bn soon, but that may now be vulnerable to internal US politics. On the other side of the Atlantic, Ukraine may be about to lose another ally.",

The ruling Law and Justice Party has promised to halt the import of cheap Ukrainian grain that Polish farmers oppose. The President, Andrzej Duda, has described Ukraine as a drowning man dragging down his rescuers. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland was \"no longer transferring any weapons to Ukraine\", although this was later reversed. So electoral politics are beginning to bite into Ukraine's support. So too are other issues, whether the global cost-of-living crisis or the climate emergency. At the United Nations General Assembly recently, it was noticeable how Ukraine was no longer automatically at the top of the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelensky's first in-person speeches to the UN assembly and the Security Council did not command the same attention as before. Diplomats noticed the sheen had come off the Ukrainian delegation as leaders from the Global South pressed their own agendas. All of this is what strategists in the Kremlin have been long been hoping for. Diplomats believe Vladimir Putin wants to wait out the West, keeping the fighting going until Ukraine begins to lose international support and seeks a political settlement. Western leaders insist they have the stamina to stay the course and show more strategic patience than Russia expects.",

His counter-argument was that if Western support for Ukraine diminished, then those pressures - whether economic or political - would only get worse: \"This is tough and this is painful. But it will only be more tough and more painful if we falter.\" To counter that impression, EU foreign ministers visited Kyiv on Monday, meeting there collectively for the first time in a demonstration of support. Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, told the BBC that the EU would maintain its military backing, so far worth more than €5bn (£4.3bn).",

But since the invasion of February 2022, the army has more than trebled in size, the nation mobilised and Jimmy's unit changed out of all recognition. We spent two weeks in August with the 24th, which now serves in the Donbas, that old centre of smokestack industries in the east, occupying a section of the front between Bakhmut and Horlivka. And we went to the home community in western Ukraine where the brigade was garrisoned before the war, and where many of its families still live. Jimmy - the Ukrainian army asks that we use soldiers' nicknames rather than their real ones - commands a company (usually about 120 troops), a post he stepped into last year. One officer told me that none of the 15 company commanders in post at the start of the war are still in place, all having been promoted or become casualties. In the run-up to war, the 24th Brigade was just over 2,000 strong, rotating its three battalions to the front line in eastern Ukraine for occasional tours of duty. Although the Ukrainian army rarely discusses numbers, sources told me it has now swelled to more than 7,000, with a total of five infantry battalions, four of artillery, a tank battalion and numerous other supporting elements",

In the meantime, they are entitled to only 10 days' leave each year. Yurii is unusual among the 24th's men in that the £2,600 ($3,195) he earns monthly (80% of which is combat pay) is less than his earnings in civilian life. Bearded, and with a banker's flair for selling a business plan, Yurii told me how the company has to be more ingenious than the Russians because the enemy have so many more drones. One of the officers revealed that although Yurii ranks as a simple private soldier, he basically runs this unit. That rethinking of the usual hierarchy is one of the differences between the pre-2022 army set-up and the force that now fights the Russians. Another is their willingness to overlook age and other factors that might have counted against volunteers before 2022. We met a sergeant nicknamed \"Hryb\" (it means mushroom) who had been put in charge of a self-propelled artillery gun",

About 120 of these died during the fighting from 2014 to the start of 2022, the remainder since the Russian invasion.
