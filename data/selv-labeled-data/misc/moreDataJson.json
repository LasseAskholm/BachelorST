Three battalions involving some 2,000 troops, dozens of armoured vehicles as well as jets have been reportedly involved in what is described as the largest-scale attack in this area. The General Staff of Ukraine says they have managed to repel dozens of attacks in Avdiivka and nearby areas since Tuesday. \"They launched their offensive on a wide front,\" Serhiy Tsekhovsky, an officer from the 59th brigade, told the BBC. \"Since the beginning of the invasion, we haven't dealt with such an intensive attack [in the area near Avdiivka]. They are using multiple rocket launchers, artillery, tanks and infantry - all at the same time.\"",

Although Russia and its proxy forces have occupied Donetsk city since 2014, they have been unable to use its resources as a key military communications hub because it is too close to the front line. By capturing Avdiivka, the occupying force could push the front line away. But Avdiivka is important not just because of its strategic role. This town has been right on the front line since Moscow annexed Crimea nine years ago and the conflict in eastern Ukraine began. As a result, the town of Avdiivka has turned into a symbol of Ukrainian resistance and resilience.",

At night, 12 KAB-500 bombs were dropped on the town.\" The BBC cannot verify his comments. Some 1,600 residents remain in Avdiivka. Most of them moved into basements long ago, but they don't always provide good protection. According to Mr Barabash, as a result of the latest attacks, one person was killed and at least two more are feared dead under the rubble. Russian attempts to move forward appear to be aimed at seizing the villages of Berdyche and Stepove to the north of Avdiivka and the villages of Tonenke and Severne to the south. Moscow asserts that its troops have \"improved their positions\" near Avdiivka and Russian military bloggers report that Russian forces have taken some strategic positions belonging to Ukrainians and already entered Stepove. Ukraine's military denies those reports but these intense battles suggest that Russia is trying to encircle the city of Avdiivka by pushing from the north and the south. The town has been well fortified and protected since 2014, making a Russian breakthrough inside Avdiivka much harder. For that reason they are trying to cut it off from the rest of Ukrainian-controlled territories and encircle it.",

    "text": "The impact of the dam explosion is so huge that it is described as \"one of the biggest human-caused disasters of our time\", in a report by US research institute, the Wilson Centre. It also says that \"more than one million hectares of land in three southern oblasts of Ukraine - Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk - will be unusable for the next three to five years for lack of a water supply\". Damage worth an estimated $2bn (£1.6bn) was caused by the breach, excluding the cost of rebuilding it, according to Ukrainian authorities. They said more than two-thirds of the affected area was in Russian-occupied territory where the flooding was worse because the bank on that side of the river is lower. Watch on iPlayer: After Kakhovka, The Kakhovka dam held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to irrigate farms as well as provided drinking water. A report by the United Nations warns that there is unlikely to be enough rain to water farmers' crops, so people have been digging new wells and laying water supply lines with help from the authorities and aid groups. With help from volunteers, Vadym is building a new house, ploughing his fields to prepare for the season ahead and plans to lay a new water supply to help his community. \"Everything will work out,\" says Vadim. \"Life is wonderful. You can give in or become stronger.\" Image source, Family handout Image caption, Ivan Sheremet was killed by an explosive in southern Ukraine at the age of 20. Two days after we left Vadym's village he received some devastating news. His 20-year-old son, Ivan, was killed by an explosive by the side of a road, not far from his home. Vadim believes it was a Russian munition, although there is no way to confirm this at the moment. Since Russia's invasion, Ukraine has become one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, according to the United Nations. The head of the Red Cross's weapon contamination unit, Erik Tollefsen, says the dam disaster dislodged mines, exacerbating the problem. \"We knew where the hazards were. Now we don't. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream,\" he told the AFP news agency. Ukrainian government \/ UN estimates Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the destruction of the dam. Two days after it started to burst, a Norwegian agency analysed seismic signals from a regional station in Romania, which indicated an explosion at the same time the dam collapse was registered. Experts with the international human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance, which is implementing Western-backed efforts to support accountability for atrocities in Ukraine, visited the Kherson region from 10 to 11 June with Ukraine's prosecutor general and a team from the International Criminal Court. The group concluded it was \"highly likely\" that Russia was behind the attack.",

It goes back to Ukraine's history in the war, as well as the make-up of Canada's large Ukrainian diaspora, said David Marples, a professor of eastern European history at the University of Alberta. During WWII, millions of Ukrainians served in the Soviet Red Army, but thousands of others fought on the German side under the Galicia Division. Those who fought with Germany believed it would grant them an independent state free from Soviet rule, Prof Marples said. At the time, Ukrainians resented the Soviets for their role in the Great Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33, also known as Holodomor, which killed an estimated five million Ukrainians.",
