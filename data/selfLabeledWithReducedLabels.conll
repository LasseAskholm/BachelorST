McCarthy’s	B-Person
successor	O
will	O
also	O
confront	O
a	O

that	O
will	O
not	O
change	O
at	O

until	O
the	B-Temporal
2024	I-Temporal

–	O
the	O

that	O

also	O

to	O

The	O

it	O
impossible	O
for	O

the	O

How	O
can	O
you	O
start	O

“I	O
am	O
completely	O

that	O
this	O

environment	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
changes	O
in.	O
But	O
from	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
,	O
what	O
is	O
probably	O
needed	O
is	O
to	O
find	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
waste	O
management	O
system	O
for	O
the	O
three	O

at	O

start	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
for	O

It	O
would	O
also	O
be	O
good	O
to	O
install	O
solar	O

use	O
that	O
as	O
source	O
of	O

There	O
are	O
of	O
course	O
more	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
step	O
by	O
step	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
also	O
things	O
that	O
anyone	O
of	O
us	O
can	O
do	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
reduce	O
our	O
own	O

what	O
those	O

are	O

the	O
magnitude	O

the	O
problem	O
with	O
plastic	O

So	O
,	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
can	O
do	O
for	O
a	O
small	O
first	O
step	O
,	O
it’s	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
how	O
much	O
plastic	O
we	O
use	O
,	O
and	O
try	O
to	O
reduce	O
that.	O
Maybe	O
skip	O
the	O
lid	O
to	O
the	O

,	O
or	O
avoid	O
the	O

The	O
problem	O
is	O
not	O
solved	O
in	O
that	O

it	O
