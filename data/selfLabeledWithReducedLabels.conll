How	O
can	O
you	O
start	O

“I	O

this	O

environment	O
to	O

in	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
changes	O
in.	O
But	O
from	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
,	O
what	O
is	O
probably	O
needed	O
is	O
to	O
find	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
waste	O
management	O
system	O
for	O
the	O
three	O

with	O

then	O
for	O

It	O
would	O
also	O
be	O
good	O
to	O
install	O

use	O

There	O
are	O
of	O

more	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
step	O
by	O
step	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
also	O
things	O
that	O
anyone	O
of	O
us	O
can	O
do	O
in	O

to	O
reduce	O
our	O
own	O

what	O
those	O

the	O

,	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
can	O
do	O
for	O
a	O
small	O
first	O
step	O

it’s	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
how	O
much	O
plastic	O
we	O
use	O
,	O
and	O
try	O
to	O

that.	O

skip	O
the	O

or	O
avoid	O
the	O

The	O
problem	O
is	O
not	O

it	O
