On the 6th of November 2023 high ranking officials of the Danish military discussed how to deploy special forces in critically vulnerable areas in Cameroon. The budget was an important discussion point since the government did not want to spend more than 5 million dkk. The budget is meant to cover equipment expenses ranging from weapons to field rations for the soldiers. The weapons needed for the snipers are Saur SIG516 rifles with scopes and tripods. The citizens of the Adamawa region In Cameroon are vulnerable to attacks from corrupt military forces. These forces have branched off from the official military in Cameroon due to a difference of opinions. With Denmark and Cameroon being allies, it was decided on the meeting, that the expenses for the military aid to Cameroon could be covered by 6.5 million dkk. Representative B.S Christiansen from the Jaeger Corps said this about the mission: “We are terribly sorry to hear about the situation going in the middle of Africa. We must do something as allies. It is with great determination that we send our finest special forces men to conquer the forces of evil.” The Danish troops are meant to land in the Littoral region of Cameroon, and then form a military caravan of carrying grenades, rocket launchers and heavy artillery. The ETA is the 3rd of December 2023. The mission carries along with it a lot of risks. The rouge military forces in Cameroon have branched into three larger groups. The biggest and most dangerous is the “Red Ribbon Army”. They carry a lot of modern weapons with highly skilled soldiers and troops. The Danish special forces have their work cut out to defeat them without taking casualties. It is important for the Danish military that collateral damage must be avoided at all costs. The democratic party of Cameroon have thanked Denmark for their contribution to the safety and peace of their country. They make it very clear that they are ready, and willing to deploy Speztnaz to assist Denmark on future military actions as a gratitude. The troubles in Cameroon have already created damages worth over 500 million USD. Cameroon is asking NATO for help to rebuild their lost cities. They are awaiting a response which should be ready today or tomorrow.
