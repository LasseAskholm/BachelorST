Centred on cybersecurity and cyberconflict, the CyberSec Summit 2023 brought together influential decision-makers, experts, and stakeholders to discuss the theme of “shielding the digital frontier”.
As NATO contends with digital threats originating from both adversarial nations and cybercriminals, Deputy Commander Lieutenant General Tom Copinger-Symes joined a panel discussion on how we can support and strengthen the Alliance’s cyber preparedness.
The event follows on directly from the 13th Cyber Commanders Forum, hosted in Krakow by the Polish Cyber Defense Forces Component Command, at which the Deputy Commander also delivered the keynote speech on the role of cloud solutions in a modern Armed Forces.
Strategic Command is responsible for leading the cyber and electromagnetic domain for Defence and as an organisation we know we must adapt and evolve, exploiting digital technologies to the best effect in both our business and battlespace.
If we are to protect, engage, constrain and fight our adversaries, Defence must fully realise the opportunities of the cyber and electromagnetic domain.
The UK is a leading ally providing its support to NATO’s effort to strengthen cyber posture and adapt to new technologies. The UK remains committed to supporting NATO’s overall deterrence and defence posture through improved cyber defence. The launch of the Virtual Cyber Incident Support Capability (VCISC) at the Vilnius Summit and the Cyber Defence Pledge are recent examples of the Alliance’s progress in this domain of operations.
